# Mo0rBy's neovim configuration

This neovim config is used by myself on a daily basis. This config uses lazy.nvim as the plugin manager.

## Plugins

- [Lazy package manager](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) (this plugin manager is required in order to install the remaining plugins)
- [Monokai colorscheme](https://github.com/tanvirtin/monokai.nvim)
