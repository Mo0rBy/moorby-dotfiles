# Mo0rBy's neovim configuration

This neovim config is used by myself on a daily basis. This config uses lazy.nvim as the plugin manager.

## Plugins

- [Lazy package manager](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) - this plugin manager is required in order to install the remaining plugins
- [Monokai colorscheme](https://github.com/tanvirtin/monokai.nvim) - my preferred colorscheme, use a different one if you want to
- [nvim-tree](https://github.com/nvim-tree/nvim-tree.lua) - a file explorer plugin, I prefer it over the default netrw plugin
