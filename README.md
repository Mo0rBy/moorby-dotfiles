# Personal Neovim configuration

Most of this setup is a copy of [this](https://github.com/radleylewis/nvim) nvim configuration. There is also a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjMzBd1Dqz8&t=3918s) going over the steps of installing all the plugins included their own configuration.

## Plugin used
- [Lazy Plugin Manager](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)
- [nvim-tree](https://github.com/nvim-tree/nvim-tree.lua)
- [telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) (note that has a dependency on ripgrep. Use `sudo apt install ripgrep`)
