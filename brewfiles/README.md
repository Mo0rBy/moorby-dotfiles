# Brewfiles directory

This directory contains Brewfiles that group packages and applications so that they can be more easily installed when setting up a new machine.

## The different Brewfiles

### basics.Brewfile

This contains some core Homebrew taps and some basic must-have applications.

It does not contain anything too specific, these are just tools and apps that I probably want on all systems.

### devtools.Brewfile

This contains all applications and tools I use for software development, including things like "wezterm", "tmux" and "neovim".

This is a fairly big Brewfile, but it only includes tools that are for software development purposes, no matter how small (like the `tree` command).

### personal.Brewfile

This contains some applications and programs that I only want installed on my own personal machines. The programs could be anything really, for example, I have "obs" for recording purposes, "qmk" to mess around with keyboards using the `qmk` firmware and "steam" for my games library.

### work.Brewfile

This contains applications and programs specific to my work environment.
